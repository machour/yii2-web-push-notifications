# Web Push Notifications for Yii2

This module provides a complete solution to implement your own Web Push notifications in your Yii2 application.

You won't need to rely anymore on a service provider like TruePush, OneSignal, ..

Out of the box, this module allows you to:

* Quickly set up a Web Push subscription mechanism on your website
* Migrate from your current Web Push provider and own your subscribers


## Summary (TODO)

* Installation
* Concepts
* Basic Usage
* Migrating from a Push Provider

## Credits

This module is based on the [minishlink/web-push](https://github.com/web-push-libs/web-push-php) library.

It began as a fork of the [web-push-php-example](https://github.com/Minishlink/web-push-php-example) repository and
turned into a full solution.
